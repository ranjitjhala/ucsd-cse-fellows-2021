# How to Apply

Each application has two parts which should be submitted separately 
by the **post-doc applicant** and their **UCSD mentor**. 

## Applicant

The applicant will submit the following via [this form](https://forms.gle/oQ4HyWuLNxEJe3tYA)

+ **2 page CV** (in addition to publications, we encourage documentation of any research impact, professional experience or contributions to diversity)

+ **2-page research statement** listing their research objectives/goals for the duration of the 2 year fellowship and the candidate’s plan for achieving those objectives/goals.  Include several milestones, and explain how any external needs, e.g., computing resources or laboratory equipment, will be met. (References do not count for the two page limit)

+ **1-page fellowship plan** that describes the research skills and experiences the candidate plans to gain during the fellowship and how these will advance their career objectives.  These might include, e.g., authoring a research proposal; improving technical presentation techniques; conference attendance; managing and motivating a (student) research team; or teaching.   This plan should be written in collaboration with the proposed mentor.  It should explain how the fellow and mentor will work together to achieve what is planned, particularly if they are not co-located in San Diego.

## Mentor

The mentor will submit the following via [this form](https://forms.gle/uyvpVtayh2QD6Dgk8)

* **Letter of recommendation** from the applicant's Ph.D supervisor

* **Mentoring letter** that will describe a mentoring plan and will 
complement the applicant’s fellowship plan.  

As part of the mentoring letter, the mentor commits to: 

1. Engage with their candidate in jointly writing and submitting 
   a grant during the postdoc’s tenure at UCSD 

2. Work with the postdoc to engage with one of our undergrad research 
   programs, for example ERSP, STARS, ENLACE, the CalTech/UCSD SURF 
   program, or any other suitable research outreach program.

## Deadlines

UCSD CSE faculty who intend to apply as mentors should then try 
to seek out suitable candidates and coordinate with them to apply 
to this program.

- Selection Notification        **August 6, 2021**
