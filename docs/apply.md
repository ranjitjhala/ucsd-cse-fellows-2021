# How to Apply

Each application has two parts which should be submitted separately by the **post-doc applicant** and their **UCSD mentor**. 

## Applicant

The applicant will submit the following via this form https://forms.gle/7mMKS6xmCjWoMT817

+ **2 page CV** (in addition to publications, we encourage documentation of any research impact, professional experience or contributions to diversity)

+ **2-page research statement** listing their research objectives/goals for the duration of the 2 year fellowship and the candidate’s plan for achieving those objectives/goals.  Include several milestones, and explain how any external needs, e.g., computing resources or laboratory equipment, will be met. (References do not count for the two page limit)

+ **1-page fellowship plan** that describes the research skills and experiences the candidate plans to gain during the fellowship and how these will advance their career objectives.  These might include, e.g., authoring a research proposal; improving technical presentation techniques; conference attendance; managing and motivating a (student) research team; or teaching.   This plan should be written in collaboration with the proposed mentor.  It should explain how the fellow and mentor will work together to achieve what is planned, particularly if they are not co-located in San Diego.

complement the applicant’s fellowship plan.  As part of this letter, 
the mentor commits to: 

1. Engage with their candidate in jointly writing and submitting 
   a grant during the postdoc’s tenure at UCSD 

2. work with the postdoc to engage with one of our undergrad research
