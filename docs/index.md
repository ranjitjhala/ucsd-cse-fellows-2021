# Program

**TL;DR** Please apply to the UCSD CSE post-doc program, **applications due August 6, 2021**.

We would like to announce the UCSD CSE Fellows program for 2021-22.
This program seeks to recruit 1-3 talented postdoctoral scholars to 
CSE. Each postdoc will be hired for a 2-year position, with a salary 
between 61-65k per year. We aim to use this program to increase the 
diversity of research in UCSD CSE, and hence, we seek to particularly 
encourage applicants whose PhD work was done elsewhere.  

## Location

We will expect postdocs to relocate to San Diego, but during 
the current pandemic we will accommodate candidates whose 
situation requires them to participate remotely.

## Mentors

Following the CIFellows model, each application must be paired 
with one (or more) UCSD CSE faculty mentors who will be named 
by the applicant. We encourage interested faculty to seek out 
potential applicants. Faculty who are already potential mentors
for the [CIFellows program](https://cifellows2021.org/) should 
encourage their mentees to apply to this program as well.
