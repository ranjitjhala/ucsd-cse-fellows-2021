# Program

**TL;DR** Please apply to the UCSD CSE Fellows Post-doctoral Scholars Program, **applications due July 30, 2021**.

We would like to announce the UCSD CSE Fellows program for 2021-22.
This program seeks to recruit 1-3 talented postdoctoral scholars to 
CSE. Each postdoc will be hired for a 2-year position, with a salary 
between 61-65k per year. The goal of this program is to attract new 
ideas and talents to UCSD CSE and thus we particularly encourage 
applicants whose PhD work was done elsewhere.

## Mentors

Following the CIFellows model, each application must be paired 
with one (or more) UCSD CSE faculty mentors who will be named 
by the applicant. We encourage interested faculty to seek out 
potential applicants. Faculty who are already potential mentors
for the [CIFellows program](https://cifellows2021.org/) should 
encourage their mentees to apply to this program as well.
